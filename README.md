# Yelp---Search-Engine

This is a Java GUI Application using Oracle as a Database.
By using this Application, the user can filter the search results using available business attributes (i.e. facets) such as main category(ies), sub-category(ies), business attributes, days of the week, and hours of a day. Each time the user clicks on a facet value; the set of results is reduced to only the items that have that value. Additional clicks continue to narrow down the searchâ€”the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
